# Desktop Startup and Anland Wayland

## Desktop auto-start

When `desktop_autostart` is enabled, the RootFS installs `desktop-session.service`. It runs the session as UID 1000 and reads `/etc/droidspaces-desktop.conf` to select the desktop.

| Desktop and backend | Manual command |
| --- | --- |
| KDE + X11 | `DISPLAY=:5 startplasma-x11` |
| KDE + Anland Wayland | `startplasma-wayland` |
| KDE Mobile + Anland Wayland | `startplasmamobile` |
| GNOME + Anland Wayland | `gnome-session --session=gnome` |
| Anland Next | `/usr/bin/anland-session` |
| Niri | `/usr/bin/niri-anland` |

After an unexpected exit, systemd retries after 2 seconds. More than 5 failures within 60 seconds pauses retries. A normal exit does not restart the session.

### X11

X11 uses `DISPLAY=:5`; install and start Termux:X11 on Android. If auto-start is disabled, run this in the container:

```bash
startplasma-x11
```

### Anland Wayland host setup

Anland Wayland supports Debian 13, Ubuntu 26, Fedora 43/44, and Arch. KDE uses patched KWin/Xwayland; GNOME uses patched Mutter. GNOME packages for Debian, Ubuntu, and Arch are published by [`droidspaces-package`](https://github.com/Goldzxcbug/droidspaces-package) and installed from its Release during RootFS creation. The Arch Niri session uses `niri-anland` and the patched Xwayland from the same Release, with `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk` and Alacritty for portals and a terminal.

Niri startup checks `/run/display.sock` and `xwayland-satellite`, then sets the Anland legacy display backend variables. Its launcher runs `/usr/bin/niri-anland` directly without `--session`.

Prepare the Android device:

1. Download the device-matching `virtual-drm-daemon.zip` from [Anland Releases](https://github.com/superturtlee/anland/releases), install it as documented by that project, and reboot.
2. Download and install `app-debug.apk` from the same Release.
3. Enable hardware access in the Droidspaces container settings.
4. Use privileged mode and enable `nocaps` and `noseccomp`.
5. Configure SELinux for the device: use permissive mode or allow the Anland display service to access the required socket.
6. Add this bind mount in the advanced options:

   ```text
   /data/local/tmp/display_daemon.sock -> /run/display.sock
   ```

Start the container and log in as the normal user. For KDE run `startplasma-wayland`; KDE Mobile uses `startplasmamobile`; GNOME uses `gnome-session --session=gnome`.

### Install or update Anland desktop packages

The build fetches matching packages automatically. To install them separately in a running ARM64 RootFS, run from the repository root:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/tui/install-anland-kde.sh
```

The GNOME installer runs on Debian 13, Ubuntu 26, and Arch Linux ARM:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/tui/install-anland-gnome.sh
```

The in-container installer supports Arch pacman packages and reads the Arch target from the `anland-gnome-packages` Release manifest.

See the [script guide](../../scripts/README_english.md#anland-kde-installer) for installer options, download sources, and verification.
