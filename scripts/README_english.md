# scripts Directory

This directory contains installers used while building the RootFS, maintenance tools copied into the RootFS, and systemd service templates. Before running a file manually, check whether it belongs in the Linux container or the image build environment.

## Droidspaces TUI

Built RootFS images provide the `droidspaces-tui` command with the shorter `dstui` and `ds-tui` aliases. It is a pure Bash terminal menu with no `dialog` dependency and works in a regular terminal or through `adb shell -t`:

```bash
droidspaces-tui
# These two commands are equivalent
dstui
ds-tui
```

Run it from a repository checkout with:

```bash
./scripts/tui/droidspaces-tui.sh
```

The main menu includes Mesa with MediaCodec VA-API, Hangover Wine, Wine fonts, and the desktop update entry for the current RootFS, and shows only `update available`, `up to date`, or `not installed` with matching colors. The desktop entry is selected by strictly parsing `/etc/droidspaces-desktop.conf`: KDE and KDE mobile show only Anland KDE, while GNOME shows only Anland GNOME. `none` or an unknown desktop opens a selector for Anland KWin or GNOME. Installed Anland state is used only as a fallback for old RootFS images that have no config file; if no component can be inferred, the selector is used. Selecting a component opens its version details and update, install, or uninstall actions. Version lookups run concurrently in the background, a dynamic Braille symbol indicates an active lookup, and a lookup that has no valid result after 10 seconds is shown as `timeout` without blocking menu input. Version detection runs when the TUI starts; entering or leaving menus and submitting invalid input do not restart it. After an install or uninstall actually starts, detection refreshes once upon returning to the main menu. Input is visible with backspace support, and Loading uses in-place redraws instead of repeatedly clearing the screen. Uninstalling patched Mesa, KWin, or Mutter restores distribution packages, while Hangover Wine and Wine fonts remove their own content. Chinese environments default to CNB, while other languages default to GitHub; the source can also be changed to automatic probing, GitHub, `gh-proxy.com`, or CNB.

Press `C` in the main menu to open cache management. The Hangover Release manifest can be removed by itself to recover from a stale manifest after a rolling Release update, or all downloads under `/var/cache/hangover-wine` can be removed. Both actions require confirmation, and cleaning all downloads means the package archive must be downloaded again on the next installation.

Press `U` to open update management. It can check for updates, update only the TUI, update only managed installer scripts, or update everything. The TUI temporarily obtains the one-time installer from the fixed `Gold-bug-tui` tag, verifies GitHub, `gh-proxy.com`, or CNB downloads against SHA-256 values from the GitHub Release API, backs up old files before replacement, and removes the temporary installer when finished.

An initial source can also be selected on startup:

```bash
droidspaces-tui --source cnb
droidspaces-tui --source github
```

## Mesa Installer

`install-mesa.sh` selects the ARM64 Mesa asset for the current distribution from the latest `lfdevs/mesa-for-android-container` GitHub Release, then installs `msm_drm_drv_video.so` from the latest stable `Re-s/droidspaces-media-decode` Release. It supports Debian 13, Ubuntu 24.04/25.10/26.04, Fedora 43/44, and Arch Linux. The media decode driver is installed in each distribution's default libva driver directory: `/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/dri` on Debian/Ubuntu, `/usr/lib64/dri` on Fedora, and `/usr/lib/dri` on Arch Linux.

The installer strictly validates Release tags, asset names, and official download URLs. Mirror downloads of the Mesa archive are verified against the SHA-256 digest published by the GitHub Release API. For every source, the media decode driver is checked against the Release API digest, upstream `SHA256SUMS`, and the published asset size. Downloads can resume, and temporary files are removed on exit.

Run interactively from the repository root:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/tui/install-mesa.sh
```

With no option, the script probes all three sources and prompts for a choice. Select a source directly for unattended builds:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/tui/install-mesa.sh --1  # GitHub
sudo ./scripts/tui/install-mesa.sh --2  # gh-proxy.com
sudo ./scripts/tui/install-mesa.sh --3  # ghproxy.net
```

The source options are mutually exclusive and apply to both the Mesa and media decode driver downloads. `-1`, `-2`, and `-3` are equivalent short options; use `--help` for built-in help. Third-party sources still require access to `api.github.com` for trusted metadata, plus `jq` and `sha256sum`. Downloads use either `curl` or `wget`.

After installation, persistent package locks are written for each distribution:

| Distribution | Lock location and mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Debian/Ubuntu | `/etc/apt/preferences.d/hold-anland-package` with `Pin-Priority: -1` |
| Fedora | Installer-managed `exclude` block in `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf` |
| Arch | Installer-managed `IgnorePkg` block in `/etc/pacman.conf` |

The lock list is generated only from Mesa packages present in the archive. KWin/Xwayland and Mutter/Xwayland are held separately by `install-anland-kde.sh` and `install-anland-gnome.sh`. Managed configuration is idempotent, and unrelated existing configuration is preserved.

## Adding a Desktop Profile

Desktop names, target capabilities, and backend compatibility live in `lib/desktop-config.sh`. To add a desktop:

1. Register its stable slug in `desktop_normalize`, `desktop_label`, and the support matrix.
2. Add an executable `desktops/<slug>.sh` whose default action installs packages according to `/etc/os-release` and whose `configure-environment <backend>` action configures desktop-specific environment variables.
3. Map its session command in `start-desktop-session.sh`; `install-desktop.sh` automatically discovers executable profiles for valid slugs.
4. Add its display label to the `desktop` choice in both workflow entry files.

All seven Dockerfiles and the reusable workflow already use the generic profile interface, so an ordinary X11 desktop does not require copied Dockerfiles. Profiles that require patched Wayland packages must also map to a package family in `lib/anland-build.sh` through `anland_package_family`.

## Anland KDE Installer

`install-anland-kde.sh` reads `anland-kde-manifest` from the fixed `anland-kde-packages` rolling Release in `Goldzxcbug/droidspaces-package` by default, then installs the matching patched KWin/Xwayland packages for Debian 13, Ubuntu 26.04, Fedora 43/44, or Arch Linux on ARM64.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/tui/install-anland-kde.sh
```

It also accepts `--1`, `--2`, or `--3` for GitHub, `gh-proxy.com`, or `ghproxy.net`; with no option, it probes the sources and prompts. Both the manifest and archive from a mirror are checked against GitHub API digests. Messages follow the system locale, and APT holds, DNF excludes, or Pacman `IgnorePkg` entries prevent upgrades from replacing the installed packages.

To install packages published by a public fork, override only the repository. The fork must provide the fixed `anland-kde-packages` tag:

```bash
sudo ANLAND_RELEASE_REPOSITORY=owner/repository \
  ./scripts/tui/install-anland-kde.sh --1
```

The Anland host module, app, SELinux policy, bind mount, and Droidspaces permissions must still be configured as described in the [project Wayland and Anland setup](../README_english.md#wayland-and-anland-setup).

## Anland GNOME Installer

`install-anland-gnome.sh` reads `anland-gnome-manifest` from the fixed `anland-gnome-packages` rolling Release and installs patched Mutter/Xwayland runtime packages for Debian 13 or Ubuntu 26.04 on ARM64, skipping test and development packages in the archive. Its source selection, mirror digest checks, and arguments match the KDE installer; APT holds prevent upgrades from replacing the result.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/tui/install-anland-gnome.sh
```

Override the GNOME repository variable when using packages from a public fork:

```bash
sudo ANLAND_RELEASE_REPOSITORY=owner/repository \
  ./scripts/tui/install-anland-gnome.sh --1
```

## USB Manager Installer

`install-usb-manager.sh` supports Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch. It installs PyQt5, ADB, udev, NTFS, exFAT, and other matching dependencies, followed by the `usb-manager`, `usb-passthrough`, and `usb-storage-passthrough` commands.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install-usb-manager.sh --user "$USER"
```

`--user USER` selects the user that receives USB management permissions and desktop launchers. When omitted, the installer tries `SUDO_USER`, the logged-in user, and then the first regular user. Development and offline tests can use a local Droidspaces-USB-Manager checkout through `--source DIR`; run `--help` for all options.

On a regular Arch system, the installer continues to install `systemd` and the remaining dependencies normally. When `/etc/droidspaces-systemd257` exists, a repeated installation preserves Pacman's `IgnorePkg` lock and no longer names `systemd` as an explicit install target; the PyQt5, ADB, NTFS, exFAT, and other USB Manager dependencies are still installed as needed.

Hardware access must be enabled when importing the RootFS into Droidspaces, or `/sys/bus/usb` and `/sys/bus/scsi` will not be visible inside the container.

## systemd 257 Compatibility Script

Dockerfiles call `systemd257.sh` when `enable_systemd257=true`. It checks the installed systemd major version: version 257 and older are skipped, while newer systems install their complete native package family from the frozen compatibility Release `systemd257-packages` in `Goldzxcbug/droidspaces-package`. Related systemd packages are then locked. New package sets are first published under an immutable tag containing the source version and repository commit; the RootFS updates the tag, per-platform SHA-256 values, expected package counts, and package-repository commit together only after that Release is complete.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/systemd257.sh
```

This is an experimental compatibility step for old Android kernels. Test systemd, D-Bus, udev, networking, and desktop sessions on the target device before distributing the resulting RootFS.

## Firmware Tool

`download-firmware` is copied to `/usr/local/bin/download-firmware` in Debian 13 and Ubuntu 24/25/26 RootFS images, but it is not run automatically. Run it inside the container when required:

```bash
sudo download-firmware
```

It installs `zstd` and `linux-firmware`, decompresses `.zst` files under `/lib/firmware`, and repairs symlinks that point to compressed files. A successful run creates `/var/lib/.fw-setup-completed`; this marker currently does not skip later runs.

## Other Build and Startup Files

- `nosnap.sh` is Ubuntu-only. It stops and removes Snap, cleans leftovers, writes APT pins that prevent reinstallation, and configures the traditional deb sources required by the project. It changes packages and APT configuration and must run as root in the target RootFS or build layer.
- `start/desktop-session.service` is the common service template. It calls `start-desktop-session.sh`, reads the desktop configuration, runs the selected session as RootFS UID 1000, and rate-limits restarts after abnormal exits.
- `binfmt/qemu-binfmt-register.sh` and its service verify kernel `binfmt_misc` support and mount it when needed; unsupported kernels are skipped safely. QEMU interpreters are still required for actual cross-architecture execution.
- `bashrc.sh` is shell configuration appended to a user environment, not a standalone installer.

## Development Checks

After changing a shell script, run at least a syntax check. Use ShellCheck when it is installed:

```bash
bash -n scripts/tui/install-mesa.sh
bash -n scripts/tui/droidspaces-tui.sh
bash -n scripts/tui/install-anland-kde.sh
bash -n scripts/tui/install-anland-gnome.sh
bash -n scripts/install-usb-manager.sh
shellcheck scripts/tui/install-mesa.sh
shellcheck scripts/tui/droidspaces-tui.sh
```

Changes to package installation or lock handling should also be tested in APT, DNF, and Pacman containers. Run each installer twice to verify idempotency.
