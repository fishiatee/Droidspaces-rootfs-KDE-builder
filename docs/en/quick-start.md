# Quick Start

## 1. Build with GitHub Actions

1. Fork this repository and open its `Actions` page.
2. Select “Build and Release Droidspaces RootFS” and click `Run workflow`.
3. Choose a distribution, desktop, display backend, and optional features, then start the workflow.
4. When it completes, download the `.tar.xz` archive from `Releases`.

A common Wayland setup uses Debian 13, Ubuntu 26, Fedora 43/44, or Arch, with desktop `KDE` and backend `anland-wayland`. You can keep the defaults for a first build. Some defaults differ between the English and Chinese workflows; see [build options](build-options.md).

Wayland builds use patched desktop packages published in `Goldzxcbug/droidspaces-package`. To use your package-repository fork, set `wayland_package_repository` to its public `owner/repository` and publish the matching Anland package Release there.

## 2. Import into Droidspaces

Create or import a container and select the downloaded `.tar.xz` as its RootFS. Enable hardware access for desktop images.

- For Debian/Ubuntu, enable `noseccomp` in privileged mode and make sure the host kernel has `USER_NS`; otherwise desktop operations may lag.
- Fedora may need hardware access enabled to avoid flicker or crashes.
- X11 desktops require Termux:X11 on Android.
- Anland Wayland also requires the [host setup](desktop-and-anland.md#anland-wayland-host-setup).

## 3. First login

If `desktop_autostart` was enabled, `desktop-session.service` starts the selected desktop when the container starts. Otherwise, log in as the normal user and run the desktop command shown in the [desktop startup guide](desktop-and-anland.md).

The default username is `Gold` and the default password is `1234` (use your custom username if you changed it during the build). Change the password after the first login:

```bash
passwd
```

`all` and `all-wayland` build multiple compatible targets. GNOME is available only on Debian 13 and Ubuntu 26; see the [compatibility matrix](build-options.md).
